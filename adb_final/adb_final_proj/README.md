**Advanced Database Systems Final Project**

**Authors**: Scott Floam and Pratik Karnik

Note to the grader: The authors of this project worked together on all functions. Both partners played an equal role in the design and coding of each function in this project. To avoid redundancy in mentioning authorship for each function, we specify this at the top of each class.

To run this program, simply complete the following instructions:

In the commandline enter:
  1. module load python-2.7
  2. python --version
  3. python -c 'import reprozip'
  4. echo $?
  5. reprounzip directory setup RepCRec.rpz ~/adb_final_repro_unzip
  6. reprounzip directory run ~/adb_final_repro_unzip
  
  You will then be prompted to enter a file name to test.
  
  Please see our **Design_Document.md** document and our **docs** folder for more information about the design and functionality of this application.
